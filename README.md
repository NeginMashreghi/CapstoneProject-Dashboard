# Capstone Project Dashboard

# PROJECT

In a simple description our project is attaching the sensors to the Microcontroller (Arduino), passing the data in the database and displaying in the dashboard.

Developing Interface (Dashboard) to display and manage data collecting from with the temperature sensor and future sensor.

Analysing the live data that’s been store every 30 min and storing in the database that’s located in AWS 

## Project Phases

### Phase 1
  
- Build phase one stage one mockups
- Present mockups to Leo Salami 
- Use feedback to break down and reconstruct application

### Phase 2

- Understanding how to pass data from arduino to web application
- Building template 
- Handling a responsive design 
- Color schema

### Phase 3

- First look of web application 
- View strengths and weaknesses 
- Final breakdown of web application 
- Now it's time to implement project vision
